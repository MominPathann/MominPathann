# Momin Khan | Aviation Data Analyst ✈️📊

**B.Sc. Aeronautics | Ex-Aircraft Maintenance Trainee | Big Data & Reliability Analytics**

I don't just analyze numbers; I analyze *metal*. 

With a background in aeronautical engineering and hands-on aircraft maintenance operations, I bridge the gap between heavy aviation machinery and high-performance data architecture. I specialize in building data pipelines that process massive, complex datasets to solve operational bottlenecks, track component reliability, and minimize AOG (Aircraft on Ground) time. 

If you are looking for a generic coder, there are thousands. If you are looking for an analyst who actually knows the difference between an A-Check and a C-Check, and can query 7 million rows of flight data to prove it—you are in the right place.

### ⚙️ The Arsenal
* **Domain Expertise:** Aircraft Maintenance Operations, Fleet Reliability, Technical Records.
* **Data Engineering:** Python (Pandas/NumPy), SQL (CTEs, Window Functions), DuckDB.
* **Visualization & BI:** Power BI, Streamlit, Plotly.

### 🚀 Deployed Operations
* **US Aviation Reliability Pipeline:** Engineered a data pipeline to process **7.07 Million** domestic flight records. Utilized DuckDB and Python to compress storage by 98% and power a zero-lag analytics dashboard for route and delay optimization.
* **Boeing 737 Component Reliability:** Extracted and analyzed FAA Service Difficulty Reports to isolate failure patterns and predict maintenance bottlenecks for the 737 fleet.
